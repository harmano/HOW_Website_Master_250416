        <p style="font-size: 35px;">
         <p>
          Professional Services Agreement
The following outlines the terms and conditions governing the services provided by House of Wrap Limited (hereinafter referred to as “House of Wrap”). By commencing the services identified in the invoice, the client acknowledges and agrees to be bound by these terms and conditions. Once the initial payment is made, the terms set forth below become binding for both parties.
<br><br>  Scope of Services
House of Wrap will supply the necessary labor, materials, and equipment for the services described in the invoice or as otherwise agreed. The scope of the project is limited to the details in the invoice unless otherwise specified. Any additional services requested or changes made by the client may incur additional costs, and a new invoice will be issued. If these costs are not promptly covered, House of Wrap reserves the right to halt the project until payments are made.

<br><br>
Liability Disclaimer: House of Wrap will not be held liable for damages to any surface, surrounding area, or pre-existing conditions at the project site. The client assumes responsibility for any changes made to the site after the initial assessment, and any damages due to such changes will not be covered by House of Wrap. All materials purchased remain the property of House of Wrap until they are installed, at which point ownership transfers to the client.
<br><br>
Payment Terms
Payment is due within 30 days of project completion, as defined under “Project Completion.” Interest of 5% per month will apply to overdue invoices. Deposits are non-refundable unless otherwise agreed in writing. House of Wrap is not liable for any work interruptions, and the initial payment is non-refundable, including in cases where the client is dissatisfied with workmanship or materials.
<br><br>Warranty
House of Wrap provides a limited warranty as outlined in the invoice. If no warranty is specified, no warranty is implied. The warranty, if applicable, covers workmanship issues such as bubbling, cracking, or shrinking of vinyl. House of Wrap does not warrant against damages due to misuse, environmental factors, or neglect. Materials are covered by their respective manufacturer warranties, and any claims regarding defects in materials must be addressed directly with the manufacturer.
<br><br>Project Timeline and Completion
The project timeline, if specified, will be followed as closely as possible. If no timeline is indicated, the project will be completed within six months from the start date. The project will be deemed complete when House of Wrap determines the services have been fully rendered, regardless of any dissatisfaction expressed by the client.
Termination
House of Wrap reserves the right to terminate the agreement if:
	•	The site conditions change after the initial assessment,
	•	The client fails to pay any required deposit for additional services, or
	•	Conditions are deemed unsuitable for completion as per the invoice or initial site assessment.
If the project is terminated by the client, House of Wrap reserves the right to charge for any portion of services completed, materials purchased, or related costs. House of Wrap is not liable for any delays or costs associated with incomplete projects due to client termination.
<br><br>Confidentiality
The client agrees not to distribute or share images or recordings of House of Wrap staff or services without prior consent. House of Wrap does not consent to being recorded on-site without prior agreement.
<br><br>Entire Agreement
This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between House of Wrap and the client, superseding any prior agreements. No changes to these terms will be binding unless agreed to in writing by both parties.
<br><br>
Liability Disclaimer: House of Wrap assumes no responsibility for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages that arise from services provided. This Agreement does not guarantee any specific outcome, and any reliance on the services is at the client’s own risk.
