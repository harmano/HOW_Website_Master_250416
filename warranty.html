         <p>The warranty provided by House of Wrap covers natural bubbling or cracking of the vinyl. This warranty explicitly excludes any damage resulting from malicious, accidental, or negligent actions that cause piercing, scratching, or any other visible damage to the vinyl, or any non-covered damages. The warranty is valid from the date of completion of the job. House of Wrap is not liable for defects caused by improper maintenance, wear and tear, exposure to harmful environmental conditions, or misuse of the materials.
          To submit a warranty claim, clients must email contact@houseofwrap.com with pictures and a detailed summary of the issue. House of Wrap will assess the claim at its sole discretion, and may choose to accept or deny the claim based on the evidence provided and an inspection if necessary. The decision of House of Wrap regarding any warranty claim is final.
         <br><br> Terms of Agreement
          House of Wrap agrees to provide the services described in the invoice (the “services”) to the client in exchange for the amounts specified. House of Wrap reserves the right to determine, at its absolute discretion, whether the services have been completed to its satisfaction. The services are limited to the scope outlined in the invoice. Any additional services requested during installation will incur additional charges, and a new, separate invoice will be generated for those services.
          If the client halts or alters the services after work has begun, House of Wrap reserves the right to charge for the completed portion of work and any materials used up to that point. Additionally, any payment received from the client is non-refundable, even if the client is not satisfied with the workmanship or materials.
          House of Wrap is not responsible for any damages to surfaces or surrounding areas where services are performed. House of Wrap does not guarantee or take responsibility for the quality, performance, or defects in any materials, including vinyl, once they are installed. All materials purchased by House of Wrap belong to the company until installed.
          <br><br>  Payment
          The client must pay the invoice in full within 30 days of project completion. Failure to do so will result in 5% monthly compounded interest on the outstanding balance. All deposits are non-refundable unless explicitly agreed upon otherwise.
          <br><br>  Warranty
          House of Wrap warranties only the specific workmanship issues detailed in the invoice or sign-off sheet. No other warranty is implied, and House of Wrap is not liable for any defects in materials or workmanship once the project is initiated. If no warranty is explicitly stated, House of Wrap assumes no responsibility for defects post-installation.
          <br><br>  Responsibility
          House of Wrap is committed to completing the services as agreed upon in the invoice or quote to the best of its ability. However, House of Wrap is not liable for factors beyond its control, including, but not limited to, environmental conditions, pre-existing surface issues, or customer-requested alterations.
          <br><br>  Project Timeline and Deadlines
          The timeline listed on the invoice is the official project deadline. If no timeline is listed, the project is expected to be completed within 6 months of starting. House of Wrap is not responsible for delays caused by third parties, material shortages, or unforeseen site conditions.
          <br><br> Termination Conditions
          House of Wrap reserves the right to terminate the project under the following conditions: changes to the surfaces, failure to pay for additional services, hostile work conditions, or any other circumstances deemed inappropriate by House of Wrap. In the event of termination, House of Wrap is entitled to compensation for any completed portion of work, materials used, and related costs.
          <br><br>  Confidential Agreement
          Clients may not distribute photos of the services, the House of Wrap team, or any work-in-progress without prior written consent. Any attempt to record or photograph House of Wrap employees during the service without consent is strictly prohibited.
          <br><br>  Total Agreement
          This agreement contains the entire understanding between House of Wrap and the client, superseding all prior communications or understandings. Any changes to this agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties.
